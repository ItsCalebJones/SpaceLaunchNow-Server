        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    </div>
<p>By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore that
    you read them carefully before using the app. You’re not allowed to copy, or modify the app, any part of the app, or
    our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the app, and you also
    shouldn’t try to translate the app into other languages, or make derivative versions. The app itself, and all the
    trade marks, copyright, database rights and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to Caleb
    Jones.</p>
<p>Caleb Jones is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve
    the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never
    charge you for the app or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.</p>
<p>The Space Launch Now app stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us, in order to provide my
    Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you
    do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed
    by the official operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious
    programs, compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean that the Space Launch Now app won’t work
    properly or at all. </p>
<p>You should be aware that there are certain things that Caleb Jones will not take responsibility for. Certain
    functions of the app will require the app to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or
    provided by your mobile network provider, but Caleb Jones cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full
    functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of the agreement with your
    mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of
    data for the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or other third party charges. In using the app,
    you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of
    your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the
    device on which you’re using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from the bill
    payer for using the app.</p>
<p>Along the same lines, Caleb Jones cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to make
    sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service, Caleb
    Jones cannot accept responsibility</p>
<p>With respect to Caleb Jones’s responsibility for your use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s important to
    bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third
    parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available to you. Caleb Jones accepts no liability for
    any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the app.</p>
<p>At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on Android and iOS – the requirements
    for both systems (and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change, and
    you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the app. Caleb Jones does not promise that it will
    always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the iOS/Android version that you have
    installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to you, We
    may also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of
    termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you
    in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your device.</p>
<p><strong>Changes to This Terms and Conditions</strong></p>
<p> I may update our Terms and Conditions from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review
    this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting
    the new Terms and Conditions on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on
    this page.

<p>If you have any questions or suggestions about my Terms and Conditions, do not hesitate to contact
    me.
