                <h2 class="title">History</h2>
                Space Launch Now started as a weekend project in 2016 for Caleb Jones as none of the current Android
                apps for Launch Library were still maintained.
                After several weeks of development and a few posts to Reddit and Facebook a small but strong community
                started to build of spaceflight enthusiast.
                We now have several active staff members and a small team of volunteer librarians and translators
                helping to bring the most accurate spaceflight
                data to phones, tablets and computers around the world.<br>

                <h3 class="title">Staff</h3>
                After several years, Space Launch Now now has a small core team of staff members that help support
                translations, librarians and the public data that is available to developers around the world. We scour
                the web for the latest updates for upcoming launches, related news articles and niche spaceflight
                events.
