                <h3>History</h3>
                Space Launch Now started as a weekend project in 2016 for Caleb Jones as none of the current Android
                apps for Launch Library were still maintained.
                After several weeks of development and a few posts to Reddit and Facebook a small but strong community
                started to build of spaceflight enthusiast.
                We now have several active staff members and a small team of volunteer librarians and translators
                helping to bring the most accurate spaceflight
                data to phones, tablets and computers around the world.<br>
                <hr>
                <h3>Staff</h3>
                After nearly three years, Space Launch Now now has a small core team of staff members that help support
                translations, librarians and the public data that is available to developers around the world.
                <h4>Librarians</h4>
                Volunteer members of the Space Launch Now community that assists in ensuring Space Launch Nowâ€™s database
                of launchers, launches, agencies, and missions stays at a high level of quality.
                <h4>Translators</h4>
                Help bring Space Launch Now to people across the globe by helping translate the launch data into your
                preferred language.<br>

                <hr>
                <h3>Technology</h3>
                All of Space Launch Now's code is publicly hosted and freely licensed on GitHub. The server hosting the
                website, discord, public API, and Twitter bots is a Django app running on the Digital Ocean platform.
                For Android, it is a fully native Java/Kotlin application that sources most of its data from the Space
                Launch Now server. On iOS for now it is built using the Flutter framework which is technically cross
                platform.<br>
